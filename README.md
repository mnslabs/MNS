## 🌟 Overview

The Minima Naming System (MNS) is a revolutionary decentralized and censorship resistant naming and identity protocol built on the Minima blockchain. 
Powered entirely by **smart contracts** and **edge-first networks**, 
it transcends traditional domain functionality by enabling unique ID identities, profiles, payments, subscriptions, DAOs, services, oracles, and networks and machine to machine interactions - all seamlessly integrated with Minima, Maxima and Omnia layers.

The **MNS**, combined with the **Mega Network** and **Micro Network**, forms the foundational infrastructure to expand the Minima ecosystem toward mass adoption, creating an incredibly powerful and flexible framework for building any system, service, or network imaginable.

- Decentralized registry and resolution (no centralized servers).
- Smart-contract–enforced ownership and actions.
- Mega Network (general purpose) + Micro Network (purpose built) for resilient discovery.
- Configurable economics to fund the ecosystem (up to 50% of revenue goes to growth and incentives).
